Atmosphere OS
Operating system designed for decentralisation.

Decentralised
Native support for all major decentralised networks like Ethereum, IPFS, Dat and others.

Modules & Layers
Modules are going to replace standalone apps by allowing developers to add extra features on top of core Layers of the OS (Transportation, Communication, Payments, etc.)

Typographic UI
The minimalist approach to the UI will enable developers to create modules without the need of designers.

Fair. Ethical. Development.

Rewards based on contribution
Contributors will be rewarded for their work with tokens. The perfect platform for this sort of reward system is Colony.

Public reputation on the blockchain
Public reputation of all contributors (including manufacturers) will ensure that the development of the project stays ethical.

Together we can build a future that belongs to the humans.

Clarity needs Software Engineers, Hardware Engineers, Product Designers, Industrial Designers, Copywriters, Project Managers, Token Experts, Blockchain developers and most of all Visionaries who seek to change how humans communicate.
Join our Slack to find out more. And check out our Github. Your ideas, time and passion are highly welcome. A map of the organisation.

Here is what we have to do:
— Complete the designs for Atmosphere OS
— Make the Whitepaper clearer
— Prepare the Decentralised Organisation

The paradox is that we are on all of these platforms which we won't support. Facebook / Twitter / Instagram / Medium
